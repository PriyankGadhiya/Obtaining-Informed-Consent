## What is informed consent?
Informed consent is a legal and ethical obligation of human rights
defenders to protect the safety, security, and dignity of their
interviewees. There are 6 main elements:

### Disclosure
The use and the purpose of the interview must be fully explained. This helps protect the interviewee’s
safety and maintains an honest relationship between interviewer and interviewee.

### Voluntariness
The interviewee must voluntarily give their permission for the interview
to be used and express whether he or she is willing to be identified by
name.

### Non-Comprehension
Donec laoreet ipsum vel pellentesque aliquet. Cras sollicitudin ac purus et vehicula. Ut nisl nisl, ultrices id leo quis, pulvinar pellentesque eros. Aliquam erat volutpat. Integer imperdiet justo et ultricies malesuada. Maecenas molestie eu ante eu ultrices. Maecenas vel augue lacus.

### Competence
The interviewee must be able to comprehend the implications of his or
her participation. This is an especially important issue with special
populations (e.g., children, people with mental disabilities, people who
have suffered significant recent trauma).

## Obtaining Informed Consent

### Step 1
Determine if your interviewee needs special consideration (e.g.,
children, persons with mental disabilities, survivors of trauma and
violence). If so, consider your options for obtaining consent from a
legal guardian or having a counselor present for survivors of trauma. Do
not proceed if you are unsure of their comprehension of the video’s
implications and potential risks.

### Step 2
Begin with an off-camera interview to introduce who you are and if you
represent a group or organization. Make sure your interviewee knows
about you and the people involved with the project.

### Step 3
Describe why you are filming and how you plan to use their interview.
Ensure the interviewee is participating voluntarily and that they
clearly understand the purpose of the project, the implications of
participating, how the video will be used, and who may see it.

### Step 4 
Ask if they want their identity protected. If anonymity is needed,
explain that you can conceal their identity while filming by using
lighting techniques or recording only their hands. Alternately, you can
propose blurring out their face or distorting their voice when editing.
Learn if they would like to use their full name, or change any part of
it.

### Step 5
Proceed with an on-camera consent or paper consent.

### Step 6

## Questions For On-Camera Consent
On-camera consent can include the answers to the following questions:

* Do you understand what we are doing? Please explain in your own words.
* Do you consent to your interview being included in this project,
including video and any other forms of media that may be used (print,
photos, website)?
* Do you know who may see the final video?
* Are there any restrictions to using the information you provide us with
or video itself that we need to be aware of?
* Are you aware that you can stop the filming process at any time in order
to ask questions or to take a break?
